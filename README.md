## 'Tis The Season for Giving
It's that special time of year again, time to crown the Prince of Presents, the God of Giving, the Baron of Bestowal. Compete against your friends to bring joy to the world through incessant present pelting. Watch out for naughty kids though. All they deserve is a nice big lump of coal.

## How To Play
Give presents to nice kids and drop coal to bullies! The player with the most points at the end of 60 seconds will emerge victorious. Also, rumor has it that if you can give presents without missing you may get a bonus...

This game supports 1 player on keyboard, and up to 4 players with gamepads (Xbox controllers work best).
